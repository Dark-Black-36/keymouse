# keymouse-loger

*Attention********************Attention*

You have to make a change in the keymouse source script. You have to enter your IP version 4 in line 15 instead of the word IP for the tool to work properly.
Also, when you run the server script, you must enter the same IP when it asks you for an IP.

Using this script, you can monitor the target mouse keyboard. I have provided only the server and target source for you here, but you can convert and use the target  source to exe file yourself using the auto-py-to-exe library.
